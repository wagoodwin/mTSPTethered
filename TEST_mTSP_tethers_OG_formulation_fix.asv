 % Background




%{
We want to take the mTSP formulation and incorporate constraints that
represent tethers
We've got two routes here.
ROUTE 1: Brute force
Make a toy example (2 robots, 3 or 4 cities) and add a bunch of tether
constraints like we talked about in our meeting. Run it and observe
the results
RESULT 2: Also Brute force, but different
Run the whole simulation and then check to see if a tether constraint was
violated. If a constraint was violated, exclude that solution, add a 
constraint that prevents that solution from happening, and resolve. 
The constraint would involve just saying x(i,j,1) and x(i,j,2) can't 
both be 1 at the same time.
In this case, we'd also make a toy problem to speed things up. 2 robots
and 5 cities.
To change between norms, just change the distance function in the 
% cost matrix.

%% Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson Subtour Elminination Constraint
% 
% % We want to outrule every possible subtour. For a 10-city system,
% % we'll have 2e10 constraints. Each constraint outrules a specific subtour.
% 
% % First thing we need to do: get a set of all subsets of the set 
% % V\{1} = {1,2,3,...,numOfCities}\{1}. This set of all subsets of V is 
% % just the set of all subtours! We don't include 1 because, if we did,
% % then we'd have tours with 1 in them, making them NOT subtours by
% % definition.
% 
% 
% 
% % Definition. A subtour is a tour that does not include the origin.
% 
% % So first get all possible subtours:
% S = PowerSet(V);
% 
% % Ensure the cardinality of the subsets lays between 2 and (numOfCities-1)
% S = S(2:end-1);
% 
% % bin represents whether a robot is inside or outside a subset. If bin = 1,
% % that means the robot is in the subset S{t}. Otherwise,
% % if bin = 0, the robot is not in the subset S{t} (can't have any tours
% % inside S). bin is per robot. 
% bin = binvar(numel(S),numOfRobots,'full');
% 
% % Now implement the constraints:
% constraintSEC = [];
% xijkSum = 0;
% xijkSum2 = 0;
% xijkSum3 = 0;
% % For each robot
% for k = 1:numOfRobots
%     % For each subtour (each set in S)
%     for t = 1:numel(S)
%         % NOW we do our double sum
%         for i = 1:numel(S{t})
%             % We sum all j's that aren't in the set S:
%             for j = 1:numel(V0)
%                 % for j NOT in S, 
%                 if( sum((ismember(cell2mat(S{t}),j))) == 0 ) 
%                     xijkSum = xijkSum + x(S{t}{i},j,k); %exits (wrt S{t})
%                     xijkSum2 = xijkSum2 + x(j,S{t}{i},k); %entrances
%                 % for j IN S, 
%                 else
%                     % Counts the number of traversals inside the subtour
%                     % S{t}:
%                     xijkSum3 = xijkSum3 + x(S{t}{i},j,k);
%                 end
%             end
%         end
%         % If the robot IS in the set, then bin(t,k) is 1, so the
%         % constraints with xijkSum3 are made. These constraints force the robot,
%         % when it's in the set, to enter at least once, exit at least once,
%         % and have a number of entrances and exits equal to each other.
%         constraintSEC = [constraintSEC, implies((bin(t,k)), ... 
%             [(xijkSum >=1), (xijkSum2 >= 1), (xijkSum == xijkSum2) ]) ];
%         % If the robot is NOT in the set, ensure that the number of
%         % traversals (measured by the number of times xijk = 1 for i,j in
%         % the set S) is equal to 0:
%         constraintSEC = [constraintSEC,implies(1-(bin(t,k)),xijkSum3 ==0)];
%         xijkSum = 0;
%         xijkSum2 = 0;
%         xijkSum3 = 0;
%         % Note where these constraints are in this series of loops.
%         % We want the constraints to be made for each robot
%         % and each subtour. 
%     end
% end
% 
% 
% % Note on summation in website: i not in S really means i in V0\S, where
% % V0 is the set of ALL nodes (including the dummy node)
% 
% % The xijkSums don't have to hold for each k. Only has to hold for one k.
% % Reason: if we did it for each k, for each subset, we'd make the robots
% % obey the constraint for each subset, forcing the robots to visit all of
% % the cities, which results in them having the same tours because that one
% % tour is the shortest for a single robot.
% 
% % Add another condition: if the robots don't visit the specific S{t}, then
% % the sum of the xijks in S{t} must be 0. Use an if-else statement here to
% % implement it. HOW DO WE KNOW IF THE ROBOTS VISITED THE NODES IN THAT
% % SUBTOUR BEFORE RUNNING THE SUM?
% 
% 
% % Couple notes after working on it:
% 
% % We do just want x >= 1. That's cause we want tour retracing, and if 
% % we force every subtour to have at least 2 different connections, we could
% % lose tours where a robot marches out to a city and then takes the same
% % route back (hence just have one retracing).

% GET ALL TOUR COMBINATIONS
function [finalTourOneCombos, finalTourTwoCombos, ...
    finalTourThreeCombos] = getAllTourCombos(RobotColIdxs,numOfRobots)
    
    % Now here, we're going to override the results of the sim and 
    % enforce the idea that a robot has stayed at a certain node for
    % an extended period of time. For example, making a robot stay 
    % at say, node 8, for more than one time step might look like this:
    
    %  RobotColIdxs = [9 8 8 10 1]
    %  RobotRowIdxs = [1 9 8 8 10]
    
    % The reason we care about robots persisting at a certain node is
    % because there's a chance an optimal tour for the robots (a tour 
    % that minimizes total travel distance or max individual tour length)
    % could involve having the robots persist at certain nodes for certain
    % periods of time.
    
    % We're going to be using MATLAB's built-in function nchoosek
    % that creates combinations for us. Note that the original tour WILL
    % be included in this list. As such, we're simply expanding the pool
    % of total feasible solutions-- we're not taking away any solutions.
    
    % Add ones at the start to complete the tours:
    totalRobotTours = [ones(1,1,numOfRobots) RobotColIdxs(:,:,:)];
    %  totalRobotTours = [RobotColIdxs(:,:,:)];

    % Designate number of slots open in each vector when we do nchoosek.
    % The number of slots is equal to 1 if ni = nmax and nmax if 
    % ni != nmax. ni is the number of non-one values in a tour and 
    % nmax is the largest number of non-one values out of a set of tours.
    % Ex. if n1 =1, n2=3, and n3=2, nmax = max(n1,n2,n3) = 3.
    
    % The number of times to repeat is related to the number of empty 
    % slots that have to be filled. Ex. [1 3 5 7 1], [1 2 1], [1 6 4 1].
    % Max number of slots nm = 3. Then, the number of repeats is found
    % by nm - ni. So for the tour 1, r1 = nm - n1 = 3 - 3 = 0 repeats.
    % r2 = 3 - 1 = 2 repeats. r3 = 3 - 2 = 1 repeats. So the repeats
    % look like [1 3 5 7 1], [1 2 2 2 1], [1 6 6 4 4 1].
    
    % So, count the number of non-one entries and put that in a vector 
    % numSlots. numSlots holds the number of non-one entries for each
    % tour. But first, get the max number of non-one entries for a certain 
    % tour:
    
    numSlots = [];
    for i = 1:numOfRobots
        numSlots(i) = sum(totalRobotTours(:,:,i) ~= 1) + 2;
    end
    
    numRepeats = [];
    for i = 1:numOfRobots
        % repelem(v,1) actually means no repeating (just copies vector),
        % so we manually adjust for that by adding 1.
        numRepeats(i) = (max(numSlots) - numSlots(i)) + 1;
    end
    
    % Repeat entries in the tour using numRepeats. numel = # of elements
    repeatVectors1 = [ 1 1 repelem(totalRobotTours(:,:,1),numRepeats(1))];
    repeatVectors2 = [ 1 1 repelem(totalRobotTours(:,:,2),numRepeats(2))];
    repeatVectors3 = [ 1 1 repelem(totalRobotTours(:,:,3),numRepeats(3))];
    % We include the 1s at the start to allow for 1s to show up in the 
    % beginning of the tour combos after doing nchoosek.
    
    
    % Now, apply nchoosek to get all combinations of tours:
    % Here's the issue with nchoosek: it gives you all combinations, NOT
    % all permutations. As such, you if you have [1 8 10 9] as a tour,
    % you'll never get [1 9 8 10] because MATLAB isn't calculating two
    % tours that have the same nodes but different orders.
    
    tourOneCombos = nchoosek(repeatVectors1, max(numSlots));
    tourTwoCombos = nchoosek(repeatVectors2, max(numSlots));
    tourThreeCombos = nchoosek(repeatVectors3, max(numSlots));

    % filter out duplicate rows (tours). Disgusting amounts of hardcoding
    % coming up:
    tourOneCombos = unique(tourOneCombos,'rows');
    tourTwoCombos = unique(tourTwoCombos,'rows');
    tourThreeCombos = unique(tourThreeCombos,'rows');

    % And now only get tours where all non-one values are in the rows.
    % That is, if a tour is [1 6 4 1] initially, we can't make a tour 
    % like [1 6 6 1] because we're throwing out 4. If we throw out 4,
    % we're not adding a time delay to the robot's touring-- we're making
    % a completely different tour!

    % find the intersection between row n in totalRobotTours and
